The package provides classifiers for soft news based on the story text and the url structure for both the US and UK news media. We provide also provide a way to infer the 'kind' of news---Arts, Books, Science, Sports, Travel, etc.---for the US news media.

    Help on method soft_news_url_cat in module notnews.soft_news_url_cat:

    soft_news_url_cat(df, col='url') method of builtins.type instance
        Soft News Categorize by URL pattern.

        Using the URL pattern to categorize the soft/hard news of the input
        DataFrame.

Installation
------------

Installation is as easy as typing in:

::

    pip install notnews

API
---

1. **soft_news_url_cat_us** Uses URL patterns in prominent outlets to classify the type of news. It is based on a slightly amended version of the regular expression used to classify news, and non-news in `Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/1130>`__ by Bakshy, Messing, and Adamic in Science in 2015. Our only amendment: sport rather than sports. The classifier success is liable to vary over time and across outlets.

-  **Arguments:**

      -  ``df``:
      -  ``url``: column with the domain names/URLs.
         Default is ``url``

-  **What it does:**

      - converts url to lower case
      - regex

      ::

          URL containing any of the following words is classified as soft news:
          sport|entertainment|arts|fashion|style|lifestyle|leisure|celeb|movie|music|gossip|food|travel|horoscope|weather|gadget

          URL conta ining any of following words is classified as hard news:
          politi|usnews|world|national|state|elect|vote|govern|campaign|war|polic|econ|unemploy|racis|energy|abortion|educa|healthcare|immigration

-  **Output:**

      -  Given both the regex can return true, the potential set is: soft, hard, soft and hard, or empty string.
      -  By default it creates two columns, ```hard_lab``` and ```soft_lab```

-  **Examples:**

      ::

        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> from notnews import soft_news_url_cat_us
        >>>
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame([{'url': 'http://nytimes.com/sports/'}])
        >>> df
                                url
        0  http://nytimes.com/sports/
        >>>
        >>> soft_news_url_cat_us(df)
                                url  soft_lab hard_lab
        0  http://nytimes.com/sports/         1     None


2. **pred_soft_news_us**: We use data from NY Times to train a `model <notnews/models/us_not_news_soft_news.ipynb>`__. The function
   uses the trained model to predict soft news.

-  **Arguments:**

      -  ``df``: pandas dataframe. No default.
      -  ``text``: column with the story text.

-  **Functionality:**

      -  Normalizes the text and gets the bi-grams and tri-grams
      -  Outputs calibrated probability of soft news using the trained model

-  **Output**

      -  Appends a column with probability of soft news (``prob_soft_news_us``)

-  **Examples:**

      ::

        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> from notnews import pred_soft_news_us
        >>>
        >>> df = pd.read_csv('notnews/tests/sample_us.csv')
        >>> df
                    src                                                url                                               text

3. **pred_what_news_us**: We use a `model <notnews/models/us_not_news.ipynb>`__ trained on the
    `annotated NY Times corpus <https://github.com/notnews/nytimes-corpus-extractor>`__ to predict the
     type of news---Arts, Books, Business Finance, Classifieds, Dining, Editorial, Foreign News, Health, Leisure,
     Local, National, Obits, Other, Real Estate, Science, Sports, Style, and Travel.

It is based on a slightly amended version of the regular expression used to classify news, and non-news in Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook by Bakshy, Messing, and Adamic. Science. 2015. Amendment: sport rather than sports. The classifier success is liable to vary over time and across outlets.

-  **Arguments:**

      -  ``df``: pandas dataframe. No default.
      -  ``url``: column with the domain names/URLs.
         Default is ``url``

-  **What it does:**

      - converts url to lower case
      - regex

    ::

        URL containing any of the following words is classified as soft news:
        sport|entertainment|arts|fashion|style|lifestyle|leisure|celeb|movie|music|gossip|food|travel|horoscope|weather|gadget

        URL containing any of following words is classified as hard news:
        politi|usnews|world|national|state|elect|vote|govern|campaign|war|polic|econ|unemploy|racis|energy|abortion|educa|healthcare|immigration

-  **Output:**

    -  Given both the regex can return true, the potential set is: soft, hard, soft and hard, or empty string.
    -  By default it creates two columns, ```hard_lab``` and ```soft_lab```
