huffingtonpost,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-black-lives-matter-memo_us_57c6f80de4b078581f1072ca,WASHINGTON ― Dont offer support for the concrete policy positions of Black Lives Matter protesters the chief organization charged with electing Democrats to the House of Representatives warned its candidates in an internal memo leaked online on Wednesday.  The document was posted online by Guccifer 2.0 a hacker who has claimed to be responsible for the Democratic National Committee email leak. Guccifer claims the document is from the personal computer of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif.. A number of cybersecurity firms and Democrats have attributed the leaks to Russian hackers though Guccifer 2.0 has denied working for the Kremlin.  Presidential candidates have struggled to respond to tactics of the Black Lives Matter movement reads the memo sent by a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staffer in November. While there has been little engagement with House candidates candidates and campaign staff should be prepared. This document should not be emailed or handed to anyone outside of the building. Please only give campaign staff these best practices in meetings or over the phone.  Black Lives Matter has become a force during the 2016 election by repeatedly calling on presidential candidates to address the systemic inequalities faced by black Americans. The movement has offered policy suggestions held demonstrations and interrupted presidential campaign speeches in order to call attention to antiblack racism.  Pelosis office declined to comment on the leak.  The memo which describes BLM as a radical movement that aims to end antiblack racism lists several suggestions for how Democratic congressional candidates should handle an encounter with a Black Lives Matter activist.  If approached by BLM activists campaign staff should offer to meet with local activists the memo reads. Invited BLM attendees should be limited. Please aim for personal or small group meetings.  Listen to their concerns it continues. Dont offer support for concrete policy positions.  The memo includes advice on what exactly to say to Black Lives Matter activists. It recommends avoiding phrases like all lives matter and warns not to bring up black on black crime since the response will garner additional media scrutiny and only anger BLM activists.  House Democrats were also advised to say that police violence requires a national conversation and to acknowledge that a history of systemic racism continues to confront the daily lives of African Americans.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee highly respects and values the leadership of the Black Lives Matter movement Meredith Kelly national press secretary for the DCCC said in a statement Wednesday. In less than two years BLM has evolved from three words into a political force that is changing and waking our nation. At the DCCC we highly encourage our candidates to not only embrace the importance of this movement but to meet with and listen to community activists to partner social change.  We will not allow this hacking to distract from our common goals nor disparage the BLM movement Kelly went on. We continue to welcome further engagement with activists and BLM leaders nationwide.  There have been a number of policy recommendations from various organizations committed to improving black life including many groups and activists connected to Black Lives Matter. Among these recommendations are police demilitarization the elimination of police profiling decriminalizing sex work and marijuana funding schools instead of prisons and pushing for workers rights.

washingtonpost,https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/02/meet-the-parents-who-wont-let-their-children-study-literature/?tid=pm_pop_b,  Daniel Fishel for The Washington Post  When I assigned an 800page biography of Andrew Carnegie for a new undergraduate course on wealth and poverty at George Mason University a few years ago I wasnt sure the students would actually read it. Not only did most of them make it to the end however but many thanked me for giving them the chance to read a popular work of history. Curious I inquired how many were history majors. Of the 24 honors students in the seminar there were none. English? Philosophy? Fine arts? Only one. How was this possible? I asked. Almost in unison half a dozen replied Our parents wouldnt let us.  The results were similar when I surveyed freshmen in another honors seminar this spring. This time I asked how many would have been humanities majors if the only criteria were what they were interested in and what they were good at. Ten of the 24 raised their hands.  I was aware of course of the drift toward preprofessionalism on college campuses of widespread concern over student debt of stories about collegeeducated baristas living in basements of governors threatening to cut off state funding for French literature and anthropology. Even so I found it shocking that some of the brightest students in Virginia had been misled — by parents the media politicians and alas each other — into thinking that choosing English or history as a major would doom them to lives as impecunious schoolteachers.  And its not just at state schools like Mason. Harvard University professor Jill Lepore recalled hosting an information session at her home for undergraduates interested in a program she directs on history and literature. One student who attended Lepore told the New York Times kept getting text messages from her parents ordering her to leave the meeting immediately.  We dont need more STEM majors. We need more STEM majors with liberal arts training.  I have heard from many different colleges that there is now a considerable — and disturbing — amount of parental pressure against the liberal arts reports Debra Humphreys a senior vice president at the Association of American Colleges and Universities. One reason for the explosion of double majors — as high as 40 percent of students at some elite schools — is that students want one major to satisfy Mom and Dad and another to satisfy their own interests she says.  Parents are becoming more deeply engaged in nearly every aspect of their childrens lives and its carrying over even to their choice of major. A lot of our students feel parental pressure to go into business economics medicine says Christy Buchanan who heads the office of academic advising at North Carolinas Wake Forest University a traditional liberal arts college that recently announced new programs in biomedical sciences and engineering. Buchanan a psychology professor who studies the role of families in adolescent development says this is what helicopter parenting has come to.           Matthew Boyce George Masons director of undergraduate admissions reports that parents are more interested than ever in the direct path between a degree program and a first job and the eventual salary associated with that degree. To many of them that pathway from liberal arts seems a little more muddled he said. Adds Saskia ClayRooks Masons acting director of career services What parents are thinking about is return on investment.  I certainly got that sense when I buttonholed students and parents at an information session this spring for high school seniors who had been accepted to Mason. To spend 80000 on a history degree Id need to see a way forward to a career said Kyle Tucker of Fredericksburg Va. as he stood with his son in the long line in front of the engineering schools booth. The boy was torn between cybersecurity and accounting. Bradley Gray of Richmond told me that he enjoys history but its hard to get a job with a history degree — thats what I hear anyway. The only opportunities are in teaching or working in a museum. Bradley is aiming for something in STEM — science technology engineering or math.  Were on the defensive acknowledges Robert Matz a Shakespearean scholar who as an associate dean in Masons College of Humanities and Social Sciences is leading an effort to promote the value of liberal arts degrees. The English departmentswebsite for example now has a prominent section What Can I Do With a Degree in English? that lists famous actors musicians judges politicians and corporate executives who were English majors.  Over the past 30 years the shift in college majors hasnt been as dramatic as many assume. As the total number of students has doubled the humanities have suffered modest losses in market share while natural and social sciences have been the big winners. But more recently in the wake of the Great Recession the number of degrees in the core humanities disciplines — English history philosophy — has fallen sharply . In the mid1960s they represented as much as 17 percent of degrees conferred now that figure is just over 6 percent.  Im a Duke freshman. Heres why I refused to read Fun Home.  This focus on college as job training reflects not only a misreading of the data on jobs and pay but also a fundamental misunderstanding of the way labor markets work the way careers develop and the purpose of higher education.  Lets start with unemployment. A study by Georgetown Universitys Center on Education and the Workforce found that in 2011 and 2012 when the economy was in the early stages of recovery the unemployment rate for recently graduated majors in humanities and liberal arts 8.4 percent wasnt all that different from the jobless rates for majors in computers and math 8.3 percent biology 7.4 percent business 7 percent and engineering 6.5 percent. Today with an improved economy the numbers for all majors are almost certainly lower.  Underemployment — the barista problem — is also overstated. When researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York looked at that issue they found that the share of recent college graduates in lowwage jobs rose from 15 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 2012 the latest year in the report — hardly an epidemic. They also found that over the years about onethird of recent graduates have always worked jobs that dont require college degrees but pay decent wages nonetheless — and that has been as true for science and business majors as for those with degrees in humanities and social sciences. Even in good times its quite typical for recent college grads to take several years to find jobs that make use of their education.  Then there is the matter of pay. The first thing to say is that reports of liberal arts majors living lives of deprivation and disappointment have been greatly exaggerated. It is true that STEM and business majors earn the most with median annual incomes between 60000 and 80000. But even the average humanities major with wages of just over 50000 earns enough to fit comfortably in the American middle class. Just as significant are the variations in incomes within majors. The top 25 percent of history and English majors earn more than the average major in science and math while the bottom 25 percent of business majors make less than the average wages of those majoring in government and public policy.  It would be a mistake of course to attribute salary differences solely or even primarily to the choice of major. One study by economists at Yale found that half of the premium earned by STEM majors can be explained not by what they learned in college but by the greater intelligence diligence and other characteristics that they brought to those majors in the first place. Or to put it another way they would have earned more no matter what they majored in.  And of course starting a major is not the same as completing it given attrition rates of 48 percent among STEM majors alas its even higher in humanities. Cal Newport a professor of computer science at Georgetown and author of the book How to Win at College has interviewed hundreds of students about their college experience. Based on those interviews and observation of his own students Newport believes that those who chose majors simply to please their parents are more likely to give up or burn out. Its just harder to weather the hard times if you dont have the intrinsic motivation he said.  How much does sexual assault cost college students every year?  You might not expect college freshmen to understand that careers dont proceed in straight lines but surely their parents ought to. In the real world most physics majors dont become physicists most psychology majors dont become psychologists and most English majors dont become writers or teachers. Youll find a surprising number of philosophy majors at hedge funds and lots of politicalscience majors at law firms. I was an American studies major. Among chief executives of the largest corporations there are roughly as many engineers and liberal arts majors in total as there are undergraduate majors in business accounting and economics combined. Indeed one study found that only 27 percent of people have jobs that are substantially related to their college majors — a reality that applies even to the STEM fields. Choosing a major is not choosing a career says Jeff Selingo author of There Is Life After College.           For me theres nothing more depressing than meeting incoming freshmen at Mason who have declared themselves as accounting majors. Theyre 18 years old they havent had a chance to take a course in Shakespeare or evolutionary biology or the history of economic thought and already theyve decided to devote the rest of their lives to accountancy. Its worth remembering that at American universities the original rationale for majors was not to train students for careers. Rather the idea was that after a period of broad intellectual exploration a major was supposed to give students the experience of mastering one subject in the process developing skills such as discipline persistence and how to research analyze communicate clearly and think logically.  As it happens those are precisely the skills business executives still say they want from college graduates — although to be fair that has not always been communicated to their humanresource departments or the computers they use to sort through résumés. A study for the Association of American Colleges and Universities found that 93 percent of employers agreed that a demonstrated capacity to think critically communicate clearly and solve complex problems is more important than a job candidates undergraduate major.  In todays fastchanging global economy the most successful enterprises arent looking for workers who know a lot about only one thing. They are seeking employees who are nimble curious and innovative. The work done by lowerlevel accountants computer programmers engineers lawyers and financial analysts is already being outsourced to India and the Philippines soon it will be done by computers. The good jobs of the future will go to those who can collaborate widely think broadly and challenge conventional wisdom — precisely the capacities that a liberal arts education is meant to develop.  What we are constantly reminding parents is that the world is an incredibly dynamic place and whats most important is for students to develop an entrepreneurial mindset said Andy Chan vice president of personal and career development at Wake Forest. They need to think not just about the first job but a lifetime of jobs.  There are some such as Georgetowns Anthony Carnevale who worry that the liberal arts model of intellectual exploration has become an unaffordable anachronism unsuited for a democratized highereducation system in which 18 million students are educated each year at an annual cost of more than 400 billion. But I tend to side with Johann Neem a historian at Western Washington University who finds it incredibly elitist to say that the masses cannot have the intellectual leisure and curiosity of an elite education.  So heres what Id say to parents who despite all the evidence still believe that liberal arts majors waste four years contemplating the meaning of life At least those passionate kids wont make the mistake of confusing the meaning of life with maximizing lifetime income.

The Democratic presidential candidate called on the FBI director to explain the new inquiry to the American people.  James Comey earlier said the FBI was looking into newly found messages.  The latest emails came to light during a separate inquiry into top Clinton aide Huma Abedins estranged husband former congressman Anthony Weiner.

The FBI would never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal offence.  Mr Comey said the FBI would investigate if the newly discovered emails contain classified information.  The FBI chief said in a letter to Congress that investigators had discovered the emails in connection with an unrelated case... that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.

In July Mr Comey said Mrs Clintons handling of sensitive material during her 200913 tenure as secretary of state was extremely careless but cleared her of any criminal wrongdoing.

google,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/how-big-is-hillary-clintons-convention-bounce-226545,Hillary Clinton just outbounced Donald Trump.  An initial set of postconvention polls out this week shows a sudden swing toward the newly minted Democratic presidential nominee and suggests Clinton begins the threemonth sprint to the general election with a consistent — but not insurmountable — advantage.  Story Continued Below  Five new public surveys each conducted over the weekend following Democrats national party convention give Clinton a lead ranging from 3 to 9 points. Four of the five pollsters point to a clear Clinton bump having found Trump ahead or down by only a single point the week before.  Whats also clear is that bump exceeds the rise in support for Trump after his convention the week prior. While Trump called his bounce the biggest bump in the history of conventions the best poll for him showed his support ticking up 6 points while other polls showed no change or a nominal Trump boost.  Clintons bounce appears to be larger. She rose 7 points in her best poll and 3 or 4 points in the other three polls for which theres a direct comparison after Trumps convention but before Clinton officially earned her partys nomination in Philadelphia.  And that postPhilly bump has given Clinton an unquestionable lead in the general election as the campaign shifts to what could be a long stretch of relative stability. With the two conventions now in the rearview mirror the next defining moment of the campaign might not come for the next eight weeks the first of three scheduled presidential debates on national television.  The bounciest of the new polls a CNNORC International survey conducted FridaySunday shows Clinton leading Trump by 9 points 52 percent to 43 percent. Thats a massive shift from just a week prior when CNNORC gave Trump a 3point lead 48 percent to 45 percent. Clintons 7point bounce over that time was larger than Trumps 6point surge from a poll conducted shortly before the GOP convention in Cleveland.  A new CBS News poll conducted over the same time frame shows Clinton ahead by 6 points 47 percent to 41 percent. Thats a 4point jump for Clinton who trailed Trump by a point in between the two conventions 44 percent to 43 percent. This uses CBS News results including voters leaning toward one candidate which CBS began to measure with the betweenconventions survey.  Trumps postconvention bounce in CBS News polls on the other hand was just 2 points.  The third poll showing Clinton swelling against Trump was from the online pollster Morning Consult. A 4point Trump lead after his convention became a 3point Clinton edge in a new survey released Sunday — with a 3point rise in support for Clinton over that time. That compares to a slightly larger 5point bump for Trump.  Another online survey a weekly NBC NewsSurveyMonkey poll released Tuesday morning gives Clinton an 8point lead 50 percent to 42 percent. Since the survey was conducted over a 7day period from last MondaySunday it includes interviews conducted both during and after the Democratic convention — but a bounce is still apparent for Clinton. Shes ticked up 4 points from last week when she led Trump by just 1 point.  Trump on the other hand got no bounce in last weeks NBC NewsSurveyMonkey poll.  Public Policy Polling the Democratic robopollster found Clinton with a 5point lead in a postconvention national poll 46 percent to 41 percent. But PPP hadnt conducted a national poll since late June when Clinton was ahead by 4 points. That suggests — after a July that included a scathing statement from FBI Director James Comey about her careless email practices and a raucous GOP convention — Clinton has emerged from her own convention still ahead.  There is one poll that continues to show Trump in the lead a web survey from the Los Angeles Times and the University of Southern California. That poll is conducted differently than most others surveying the same respondents day after day over the course of the campaign rather than selecting a new random sample for each poll.  But there are other measures that point to Clinton having a more successful convention at least as reflected in the polls. While Gallup isnt conducting public horserace polling this cycle the legendary pollster found voters were more likely to say they had a more favorable impression of the Democratic Party following its convention than the GOP after its gathering. Moreover more respondents narrowly said the Democratic convention made them more likely to vote for Clinton than less likely — while a 51percent majority of adults surveyed said the GOP convention actually made them less likely to vote for Trump. And while Trumps acceptance speech in Cleveland beat Clintons in television ratings respondents to the Gallup poll gave higher marks to Clintons speech.  Clintons favorability rating is on the rise following her convention though it remains historically poor for a major party nominee. In the CBS News poll Clintons favorable rating now stands at 36 percent up from 31 percent before the convention. The percentage of voters who have an unfavorable opinion of Clinton shrank from 56 percent last week to 50 percent now.  Gallup is seeing a definite increase in Clintons favorable rating in its rolling oneweek samples measuring both candidates favorability. The most recent update includes Americans surveyed last Monday through Sunday during and after the Democratic convention. Clintons favorable rating is now at 42 percent — up from 37 percent a week ago. Trumps on the other hand has slid back to 34 percent after peaking at 37 percent last week.  While the CNNORC poll shows the most dramatic swing on the ballot test it is stable with regard to Clintons image rating. The poll shows Clintons favorable rating ticking up to 43 percent from 41 percent the week prior. And the percentage of voters who have an unfavorable opinion dropped just a single point from 55 percent last week to 54 percent this week.  The data — reflected in the five polls released over the past 48 hours — are somewhat limited thus far. And with the exception of a PPP poll in Pennsylvania there hasnt been any battlegroundstate polling since the Democratic convention to confirm Clintons bounceback extended to the states that really matter.  The polls typically become more predictive of the final result following both conventions. And there are only a few defined moments left on the calendar on which the election could be decided including the three scheduled ClintonTrump debates. The first one on Long Island is in just under eight weeks — an extended period of campaigning for both candidates without the automatic national attention that comes with a convention or a debate.  In the interim both candidates are plugging away on the campaign trail. But Clinton — and her allied super PAC Priorities USA Action — is the only one actively advertising on television in the battleground states giving her the opportunity to lock in the advantage with which she is leaving the conventions according to the polls.

We are in New York City tonight and it was interesting today to see all of these voting sites with huge lines. That is the definition of a symbolic vote — New York State is of course not in play. But if Trump loses by a lot here in the city he calls home that is certainly worthy of note.

Khan a Muslim American soldier was killed in Iraq in 2004 when he ran toward a suicide bomber saving the lives of the men he was in charge of.  Khizr Khan the soldiers father told the story of his sons life and sacrifice powerfully at the convention — while chiding Donald Trump for his comments about banning Muslims from entering the country. Trump attacked Khan as a Democratic shill playing on grief to help elect Clinton.  Khizr Khan is back. This ad released by the Clinton campaign on Friday afternoon features Khan telling his story again.  The Hillary Clinton campaign released an ad on Oct. 21 featuring Khizr Khan who made a passionate speech at the Democratic National Convention about his son Humayun Khan who died while serving in Iraq as a captain in the Army in 2004. Hillary Clinton  It shows Khan walking through his home looking at his sons medals and pictures. The 60second ad ends with a closeup of a tearyeyed Khan saying this I want to ask Mr. Trump Would my son have a place in your America?  Its a remarkably powerful ad connecting Trumps rhetoric on Muslims to the real pain that such a pledge would inflict on Muslim Americans. Real people would be affected by all of these proposals the ad reminds us. Its not just words by Trump.  The ad according to the Clinton campaign will rotate into swing states including Florida Iowa Nevada New Hampshire North Carolina Ohio and Pennsylvania.  Im not sure that any ad fundamentally alters the trajectory of this race. TV commercials have become less relevant as the number of people watching traditional television live has declined. Plus Clinton and Trump are totally known figures about whom very few people lack an opinion.  But if there is an ad that breaks through the clutter while also reminding people of the stakes in the election this might be the one.

I dont mean in your personal life where you should keep calm and carry on. I mean politically. Think about it carefully The fate of the republic may depend on your answer.  Of course nobody knows whether there will be a shocking 911type event or what form it might take. But surely theres a pretty good chance that sometime over the next few years something nasty will happen — a terrorist attack on a public place an exchange of fire in the South China Sea something. Then what?  After 911 the overwhelming public response was to rally around the commander in chief. Doubts about the legitimacy of a president who lost the popular vote and was installed by a bare majority on the Supreme Court were swept aside. Unquestioning support for the man in the White House was many Americans believed what patriotism demanded.  The truth was that even then the urge toward national unity was onesided with Republican exploitation of the atrocity for political gain beginning almost immediately. But people didnt want to hear about it I got angry mail not just from Republicans but from Democrats whenever I pointed out what was going on.  Photo  Unfortunately the suspension of critical thinking ended as such suspensions usually do — badly. The Bush administration exploited the post911 rush of patriotism to take America into an unrelated war then used the initial illusion of success in that war to ram through huge tax cuts for the wealthy.  Bad as that was however the consequences if Donald Trump finds himself similarly empowered will be incomparably worse.

Every day brings further evidence that this is a man who completely conflates the national interest with his personal selfinterest and who has surrounded himself with people who see it the same way. And each day also brings further evidence of his lack of respect for democratic values.  You might be tempted to say that the latest flareup over Nordstroms decision to drop Ivanka Trumps clothing line is trivial. But it isnt. For one thing until now it would have been inconceivable that a sitting president would attack a private company for decisions that hurt his familys business interests.  But whats even worse is the way Sean Spicer Mr. Trumps spokesman framed the issue Nordstroms business decision was a direct attack on the presidents policies. Létat cest moi.

Previous presidents including Barack Obama have disagreed with and complained about judicial rulings. But thats very different from attacking the very right of a judge — or as the man who controls 4000 nuclear weapons put it a socalled judge — to rule against the president.  The really striking thing about Mr. Trumps Twitter tirade however was his palpable eagerness to see an attack on America which would show everyone the folly of constraining his power  Never mind the utter falsity of the claim that bad people are pouring in or for that matter of the whole premise behind the ban. What we see here is the most powerful man in the world blatantly telegraphing his intention to use national misfortune to grab even more power. And the question becomes who will stop him?  Dont talk about institutions and the checks and balances they create. Institutions are only as good as the people who serve them. Authoritarianism Americanstyle can be averted only if people have the courage to stand against it. So who are these people?  It certainly wont be Mr. Trumps inner circle. It wont be Jeff Sessions his new attorney general with his long history of contempt for voting rights. It might be the courts — but Mr. Trump is doing all he can to delegitimize judicial oversight in advance.  What about Congress? Well its members like to give patriotic speeches. And maybe just maybe there are enough Republican senators who really do care about Americas fundamental values to cross party lines in their defense. But given what weve seen so far thats just hopeful speculation.  In the end I fear its going to rest on the people — on whether enough Americans are willing to take a public stand. We cant handle another post911style suspension of doubt about the man in charge if that happens America as we know it will soon be gone.
