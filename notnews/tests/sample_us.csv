nyt,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/us/politics/jared-kushner-israel.html,Mr. Kushner on something of a crash course in diplomacy has been speaking with Arab leaders in recent weeks. But he is a mystery to most Middle Eastern officials. He has no experience in government or international affairs. His upclose exposure to the Arab world amounts to little more than trips to a handful of Persian Gulf countries and a starstudded jaunt to Jordan.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Though Mr. Kushner has visited Israel since childhood and more recently to do business he is little known there. He holds strong views about the state of Israel but he has not been outspoken about them save for editorials in The New York Observer the newspaper he owned. His thinking on matters like settlements is not well understood.  Israel wasnt a political discussion for him it was his family his life his people said Hirschy Zarchi rabbi at the Chabad House at Harvard where Mr. Kushner was an undergraduate.  Photo  Rather than diplomatic experience Mr. Kushner has ties to Israel that are personal and religious. His visit to Auschwitz was stark but its themes were not new to him. His grandmother survived the Holocaust by crawling through a homemade tunnel in Poland. His grandfather escaped the massacres by hiding in a hole for years. An Orthodox Jew Mr. Kushner was instructed to protect Israel remember the genocide and assure the survival of the Jewish people those close to him say.  He was educated at Jewish schools where second graders were expected to draw maps of Israel from memory and the West Bank was often referred to by its biblical names Judea and Samaria a practice that emphasizes Jewish claims to the land. His family used its real estate fortune to donate millions of dollars to American Jewish and Israeli hospitals schools and other institutions including a few in settlements according to public records. In his classes Palestinians were regarded at a distance in part as security threats who committed acts of terrorism — including one that killed a sister of a classmate of Mr. Kushners.  When Mr. Trump ran for president his soninlaws stances on Israel helped shape the campaign. Mr. Kushner helped script a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and consulted with Netanyahu officials behind the scenes. When he brought the candidate and the prime minister together for a meeting his father Charles Kushner was invited to join them.  Thanks in part to the younger Mr. Kushner Mr. Netanyahu will arrive at a White House that has already adopted many of the prime ministers perspectives on the region. Now Mr. Kushner is helping Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu craft a strategy to recruit Sunni Muslim countries that oppose Iran to help foster an IsraeliPalestinian peace agreement. The approach is a long shot Negotiations are dead. The Israeli right is pushing for more settlement in the West Bank as talk among Palestinians turns to a single state in which they have equal rights.  Mustafa Barghouti a Palestinian leader who was involved in peace talks both with Israelis and internally said Palestinians were skeptical of Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trumps team generally seeing them as close only to the Israeli side. As part of its philanthropy Mr. Kushners family has made donations to the Beit El settlement which Mr. Barghouti finds particularly worrisome.  Photo  We need somebody who is really impartial Mr. Bargouti said pointing out that it is unclear whether Mr. Kushner has ever visited a Palestinian area the White House would not say. There is no indication he is interested in hearing from the other side.

But others said his life had given him cause to believe in the improbable. His grandparents survived against all odds then came to America and made the kind of money of which most people can only dream. Mr. Kushner plunged into his fatherinlaws presidential campaign with no experience and helped him win.  This is a region that has resisted solutions from people with vast résumés said Ken Kurson editor of The New York Observer suggesting that his former boss may do better. For 60plus years weve been sending the best diplomats in the world and its yielded zero results.  Faith and Family  Mr. Kushners religious upbringing may have been intense but his high school yearbook message was laidback with an ode to his brokenin sneakers. He was a 6 ft. 2 inch basketball and hockey player who just loves to be comfortable the message said noting that he also liked to deliver frozen yogurt and Slurpees to his siblings.  There was little mention of Jewish identity beyond his Hebrew name Yoel Chaim. But that was Mr. Kushner classmates said in recent interviews easygoing and polite a decent student but not a standout not particularly engaged in religious questions or the urgent political matters of the day. He did not participate in the high school club devoted to criticizing coverage of Israel in The New York Times. Many of his peers spent a year after graduation studying religious texts in Israel he did not.  But his family was busy building a world to replace the one it had lost schools organizations synagogues campuses. The Kushners Judaism and support of Israel were one and the same friends said about ensuring survival.  Photo  The major Jewish institutions of Mr. Kushners life — school and synagogue — emphasized the connection between religion and Zionism. In the modern Orthodox community the state of Israel has an important place in identity as a religious ideal not only a political reality said Elie Weinstock rabbi at Kehilath Jeshurun the Manhattan synagogue Mr. Kushner joined.  At his elementary school the Hebrew Youth Academy in Livingston N.J. it was impossible to walk the halls without seeing the flags of Israel and Israeli historical figures and how the kids celebrate Israeli holidays said Stephen Flatow whose daughter Ilana was in Mr. Kushners grade.  In eighth grade their class was stunned by the killing of Ilanas older sister Alisa in a bus bombing in the Gaza Strip. The school community couldnt fathom how a young man can load himself up with dynamite and blow himself up in a van and have his parents celebrating his death Mr. Flatow said. A few years later the school was renamed for Jared Kushners grandfather Joseph and when a new building opened the family dedicated the flagpole that flies the Israeli flag to Alisas memory.

During high school at the Frisch School in northern New Jersey where Mr. Kushner spent long days attending mandatory prayers morning and afternoon and studying in English Hebrew and Aramaic the language of the Talmud every year of his education was interwoven with events in Israel. In 1995 when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated teachers and students mourned together. In 1996 a recent graduate named Sara Duker was killed in another bus bombing sending shock waves through the school again. In 1997 about the time Mr. Kushner was on a sixweek summer trip to Israel a double suicide bomb in the main Jerusalem market killed more than a dozen people.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But classmates say the environment Mr. Kushner lived in could feel apolitical because most everyone shared similar views and Palestinian perspectives were barely considered. Some teachers told students that Palestinian was a madeup identity a label adopted for political reasons. There was little discussion of what it was like to live under occupation several classmates of Mr. Kushners recalled. Many rabbis and teachers seemed comfortable with settlements and some students said they never learned that Israels borders were a highly contested topic.  There was such an assumption that Jews deserve to have this place that it was theirs for thousands of years by biblical fiat said Eli Schleifer who graduated the year before Mr. Kushner. There was such a strange blindness to the complexity of the situation.  In 1999 Mr. Kushner left New Jersey for Harvard where he no longer wore a skullcap to classes but continued to follow rules of Orthodox Jewish life. Jordan Reid Strauch a friend of Mr. Kushners could not recall his mentioning Israel. Soon the second intifada or Palestinian uprising was setting off criticism of Israel on campus and then responses from students who defended the country but Mr. Kushner kept his head down.  Instead he spent time at the Chabad House where Rabbi Zarchi was struck by how Mr. Kushner never felt the need to apologize for his differences his religious commitments he said.  Mr. Kushner sometimes expressed his views during long Sabbath meals at the house. He certainly believed that a strong and secure Israel was in America and the worlds best interest Rabbi Zarchi said. He didnt believe that Israel needed the approval of Europe the United Nations or even Washington or London the rabbi continued.  Photo  While Mr. Kushner was at Harvard Mr. Netanyahu once again visited his father speaking at his office kicking a soccer ball at one of the schools that carried the family name and sitting down for a tabbouleh lunch with students including Jareds younger brother Joshua.  Mr. Netanyahus visits helped lead to an unexpected outcome Charles Kushners brother Murray sued him for misusing the family companys funds by paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to the Israeli leader among other highprofile figures. The suit was eventually settled but it set off investigations and misdeeds by Charles Kushner that eventually led to a twoyear prison sentence for tax evasion witnesstampering and making illegal campaign donations.  A few years later Charles Kushner and Mr. Netanyahu still seemed close When the Israeli media obtained Mr. Netanyahus partly handwritten list of wealthy Americans most likely to fund his partys primary elections Mr. Kushner was near the top.  Photo  A Formidable Task  Last June in Washington Yousef alOtaiba the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates received an unexpected request from his friend Thomas Barrack Jr. a LebaneseAmerican businessman and Trump fundraiser Would he meet with Jared Kushner?  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  What struck me in our first meeting is that he asked a lot of questions and listened Mr. Otaiba said. Since then the two have been in touch with Mr. Kushner playing the student asking Mr. Otaiba for his impressions of shifting forces in the Middle East Syria Iran extremism relationships.  Mr. Kushner had become a force in his familys real estate business and a member of a synagogue known for a brand of religious Zionism similar to the one he was raised with. He took out loans for the real estate business from Israels Bank Hapoalim and almost bought a major Israeli insurance company called Phoenix.  Though he had been raised a Democrat Mr. Kushner endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race in part because of disappointment with President Barack Obama on Israel. Rather than strengthen the nations relationship with Israel as the Arab world imploded Mr. Obama treated Jerusalem as less a friend than a burden the Observer endorsement read using language similar to what Mr. Trump would eventually say.  Now Mr. Kushner has given up his life in New York for a government ID card and a groaning portfolio. Many foreign policy experts wait their entire careers for a White House job but Mr. Kushner is fielding inquiries from foreign leaders even as he is still learning to navigate the subject. He is far from the first American Jew with strong ties to Israel to wade into Middle Eastern diplomacy — Rahm Emanuel the former White House chief of staff is the son of a former Jewish paramilitary fighter — but the others were Washington professionals or seasoned negotiators.  In his first weeks in the White House Mr. Kushner has had exchanges with officials from Egypt Saudi Arabia Mexico and elsewhere and greeted King Abdullah II of Jordan whom he met several years ago on a trip to that country that included the actors Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman.  It is unclear what shape Mr. Kushners role will take especially as figures like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and others in the foreign policy apparatus become engaged in Middle Eastern diplomacy. Some observers see Mr. Kushner as a welcome counter to an unpredictable president and to firebrands like Stephen K. Bannon the White House strategist and David M. Friedman the ambassador designate to Israel.  Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.  Mr. Kushner could be a moderate voice said Dan Gillerman Israels former ambassador to the United Nations who got to know Mr. Kushner in New York. The strange thing is that 36yearold kid may end up being the grownup in the room.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Many years after his teenage encounters with Mr. Netanyahu he may also be in a position to help the Israeli leader who is facing multiple corruption investigations and everstronger challenges from the right.  But Mr. Kushners task is formidable. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump want to set in motion a chain of events that could block Iran redefine Israels relationship with the Arab world and create IsraeliPalestinian peace — the deal that cant be made as Mr. Trump has said.  The prime minister is coming into the meeting with the hope to forge a common policy with the president and Jareds role is critical in that said Ron Dermer the ambassador of Israel with whom Mr. Kushner has been in close contact. Hes someone who in my interactions with him has really been able to deliver.

The chilling video which was posted to Steve Stephens personal Facebook page around 2 p.m. local time showed him driving in his car and complaining about a woman. He then approached an elderly black man shot him at close range and drove off.  The Cleveland Police Department issued an arrest warrant for Stephens 37 shortly after midnight on Monday in connection with the slaying of 74yearold Robert Godwin Sr.  Rep. Marcia L.

nyt,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/us/politics/donald-trump-health.html,Photo  WASHINGTON — In releasing a far more sober account of Donald J. Trumps health on Thursday his physician provided details to support his view that the Republican nominee for president is overweight but otherwise is in excellent physical health.  The new account from Dr. Harold N. Bornstein of Manhattan was in a more conventional style than his unusual letter of last December that offered scant objective data to support his gushing subjective appraisal of Mr. Trumps health. Mr. Trump 70 has repeatedly pledged to release a full medical report as other candidates in recent presidential campaigns have done to help voters judge their ability to bear the stress of the presidency and complete a full term.  Dr. Bornsteins latest letter dated Sept. 13 was based on his examinations of Mr. Trump every spring and another physical he reportedly underwent last week. It omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patients health.  For example it did not contain results of any tests on Mr. Trumps kidney function. Yet Dr. Bornstein wrote that Mr. Trumps liver and thyroid function tests were all in the normal range as was his prostate specific antigen or PSA level of 0.15.  The 2015 letter said Mr. Trump did not use tobacco or alcohol products and had no history of cancer or bone or joint surgery. His only reported surgical operation was an appendectomy at age 10.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Here is an assessment of the medical history Mr. Trump has made public and here is one of the history that Hillary Clinton the Democratic presidential nominee has made public.  Weight and Dietary Health  Mr. Trump is 6foot3 and weighs 236 pounds. In his letter of last December Dr. Bornstein said Mr. Trump had lost at least 15 pounds in the previous 12 months. In the new letter Dr. Bornstein did not state what Mr. Trump had weighed in each of the annual checkups he has conducted since 1980 or any trends over that period of time. Weight is a standard part of a medical checkup.  Mr. Trump who often eats fast food says he would like to shed a few pounds. But Dr. Bornstein did not write about Mr. Trumps overall diet and what nutritional and exercise advice he offered his patient to achieve his weightreduction goal.  Cardiac Health  Mr. Trumps blood pressure was normal at 11670 as were his cardiac tests. The tests included an electrocardiogram an ultrasound examination of his heart and a chest Xray. Mr. Trump takes lowdose aspirin to reduce the chances of a heart attack and a drug called rosuvastatin marketed as Crestor to lower his cholesterol and other lipids. Dr. Bornstein did not state how high the lipids were before statin therapy. But the levels were in the normal range in the recent tests cholesterol 169 HDL cholesterol 63 LDL cholesterol 94 triglycerides 61. Mr. Trump cited no family history of premature heart disease.

According to an algorithm developed by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and known as MESA for multiethnic study of atherosclerosis his risk of a heart attack is 0.7 percent for each of the next 10 years. That measure is higher than the less than 0.2 percent for Mrs. Clinton. Because Mr. Trump is taking a statin another algorithm developed by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association does not apply to his case and so cannot be compared with his rivals.  Dr. Bornstein has described Mr. Trumps physical strength and stamina as extraordinary. But he has provided no objective measurements to support the opinion.  Neurological Assessment  Because Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are in the age range of increased risk for Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia many experts have urged that they take neurocognitive tests and mental status tests that can detect early clues to dementia. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mrs. Clinton has said whether they have taken such tests.  Mr. Trump has said he was blessed with great genes — both of my parents had very long and productive lives. Dr. Bornstein wrote that Mr. Trumps father Fred Trump lived into his 90s and his mother into her late 80s. But Dr. Bornstein did not mention that Fred Trump developed Alzheimers disease beginning in his late 80s. The genetics of most forms of Alzheimers and dementia are not known with certainty. Doctors consider it prudent to be aware of such a risk and for patients to be checked if specific signs become apparent.  Dr. Bornstein did not mention Mr. Trumps mental status or summarize a neurological examination. Mrs. Clintons physician Dr. Lisa Bardack of Mt. Kisco N.Y. described her patients mental condition as excellent.  Orthopedic Issues  Dr. Bornstein did not mention any orthopedic problems. Mr. Trump received a draft deferment during the Vietnam War because of a bone spur in his foot. When asked about it last year by reporters Mr. Trump said he could not recall which foot was afflicted.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Medication and Immunizations  Beyond the aspirin and the statin Mr. Trump takes regularly he is not on any other medication. Dr. Bornstein did not state whether Mr. Trump is up to date on a standard schedule of immunizations against pneumococcal pneumonia influenza or other infections.
google,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/17/turkey-rounds-up-52-military-seeks-to-detain-53-judges.html,The Turkish government on Sunday ratcheted up its crackdown on alleged plotters of the botched coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan detaining as many as 6000 people including military officers and issuing dozens of arrest warrants for judges and prosecutors according to government officials.  Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said in a television interview that the cleansing operation is continuing. Some 6000 detentions have taken place. The number could surpass 6000.  Detention orders were for 53 more judges and prosecutors while 52 military officers were rounded up for their alleged roles in the failed coup Turkeys staterun Anadolu news agency reported.  Bozdag also said he was confident that the United States would return Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen to Turkey. The Turkish president has blamed Gulen and his followers for the failed military coup on Friday night but Gulen has denied any involvement in or knowledge about the attempted coup. The U.S. says it will look at any evidence Turkey has to offer against Gulen and judge accordingly.  Bozdag says the United States would weaken itself by protecting him it would harm its reputation. I dont think that at this hour the United States would protect someone who carried out this act against Turkey.  Erdogan spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the failed coup attempt Turkish officials told reporters.  Putin said Moscow stood by Turkeys elected government and expressed his good wishes to Turkeys people a Turkish government statement added.  It said the two leaders  who recently patched up relations following Turkeys downing of a Russian warplane  also agreed to meet facetoface next month.  The reports Sunday followed an intensive crackdown against the judiciary and the military in the wake of the botched coup Friday night.  Already three of the countrys top generals have been detained alongside hundreds of soldiers. The government has also dismissed nearly 3000 judges and prosecutors from their posts while investigators were preparing court cases to send the conspirators to trial on charges of attempting to overthrow the government.  The botched coup which saw warplanes fly over key government installations and tanks roll up in major cities briefly ended hours later when loyal government forces including military and police regained control of the military and civilians took to the streets in support of Erdogan.  At least 265 people were killed and more than 1400 were wounded. Government officials say at least 104 conspirators were killed.  Still the coup appears to have boosted Erdogans popularity. Clapping singing and dancing thousands of government backers celebrated the defeat of the coup in public squares in Ankara and Istanbul into the wee hours Sunday bolstering support for the man whos led Turkey for over 13 years.  Erdogans survival has turned him into a sort of a mythical figure and could further erode democracy in Turkey said Soner Cagaptay director of the Turkish research program at The Washington Institute.  It will allow him to crack down on liberty and freedom of association assembly expression and media in ways that we havent seen before he said.  Gozde Kurt a 16yearold student at a rally in Istanbul said Sunday that just a small group from Turkish armed forces stood up against our government ... but we the Turkish nation stand together and repulse it back.  The Yeni Safak newspaper used the headline Traitors of the country while the Hurriyet newspaper declared Democracys victory.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

yahoo,https://www.yahoo.com/news/pittsburgh-symphony-musicians-reject-pay-cuts-strike-154655448.html,PITTSBURGH AP — Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra musicians went on strike Friday after unanimously rejecting calls for a 15 percent pay cut but management contends those cuts and others are necessary because the orchestra is more than 20 million in debt.  Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra musicians are exceptional artists and deserve every dollar and every benefit we can afford to offer said Melia Tourangeau who took over as symphony president and CEO last year. At the same time we must squarely confront the very real financial crisis that we are facing.  Tourangeau said managements demands are part of a fiveyear growth model to sustainability. But the need for immediate cuts is necessary because of a recent financial assessment that showed the orchestra would run out of cash and have to close the doors in MayJune 2017 board chair Devin McGranahan said.  Symphony managers say the orchestra is running a 1.5 million annual deficit and faces more than 20 million in cumulative debt over the next five years.  They say the pension fund needs at least 10 million over the next five years to remain solvent. Thats one reason they say they wants to freeze pensions for any musician with less than 30 years experience and move them into a 401k plan — another move that prompted the strike.  The musicians have agreed to concessions in the past most recently a nearly 10 percent pay cut in 2011 to help the orchestra deal with funding issues. The proposed immediate 15 percent pay cut would reduce each musicians base pay from 107239 to 91153 the union said with annual raises of 2 percent and 3 percent in each of the next two years.  The consequences of those cuts would be severe and immediate the union said in a statement announcing the strike. It predicted musicians would leave and the symphony would be unable to attract topnotch players.  However management contends several musicians earn more than double the base pay for certain position. Musicians also get up to 10 weeks vacation and 12 weeks of sick time each year plus overtime and seniority pay management said.  The last threeyear contract expired Sept. 5. Contract talks had continued with a federal mediator but the union contends management wouldnt budge from its last offer which was rejected Thursday. The musicians have offered unspecified major concessions on salary pension and size of the orchestra — all the topics that are the focus of managements demands the union said.  The union contends management also wants the right to unilaterally cut orchestra staff currently 99 musicians and two librarians by an unspecified number. Management said only that it wants to leave three vacant positions unfilled but didnt otherwise address staffing numbers.  The union contends ticket sales are up and that donations to the orchestras annual fund broke a record. Management doesnt dispute that but said the other changes still are necessary.    This story has been corrected to show the symphony presidents first name is Melia not Malia.
foxnews,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/13/clinton-camp-mills-potential-conflict-interest-absurd.html,Hillary Clintons campaign is questioning a report about a top aide to Clinton when she was secretary of state also conducting interviews for the Clinton Foundation saying implications about a potential conflict of interest are absurd.  ThenChief of Staff Cheryl Mills took an Amtrak train from Washington to New York City in June 2012 to interview two executives to potentially become the foundations next leader sources told CNN which first reported the story.  Clinton purportedly accepted the secretary of state post in 2009 in part on the condition that any foundation activity would neither create conflicts nor the appearance of conflicts of interest for her.  The CNN report doesnt state Mills broke any rules but suggested her interviewing trip has added to the blurred lines between Clintons government work and nongovernment activities which have long created problems for her and husband President Bill Clinton.  Hillary Clintons use of a private server as secretary of state to send and receive official emails has also added to that perception.  The Clinton campaign said Friday that Mills volunteered her personal time and paid for her own travel to New York City.  2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →  And it was crystal clear to all involved that this had nothing to do with her official duties the campaign said. The idea that this poses a conflict of interest is absurd.  Mills attorney also purportedly said such work was voluntary.  The foundation did not immediately respond to a FoxNews.com request Saturday for comment.  The CNN report comes the same week as a new batch of Clinton emails seemed to show foundation donors got preferential treatment during Clintons tenure at the State Department.  Conservative watchdog Judicial Watch released the 44 new email exchanges which the group says were not in the original 30000 handed over to the State Department. Clinton has repeatedly claimed she turned over all workrelated emails during the nowclosed probe into her private server use.  The documents challenge Clintons insistence that there was no connection between the foundation and her work at the State Department.  In one email exchange Doug Band an executive at the Clinton Foundation tried to put billionaire donor Gilbert Chagoury  a convicted money launderer  in touch with the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon because of the donors interests there.  And a report this week by The Daily Caller says that several investigations are being launched including one led by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Civil Frauds Unit that will focus on the foundations dealings in New York. The agency has declined to comment.  The Senate Judiciary Committee led by Sen. Chuck Grassley RIowa has also tried to get answers about Mills New York trip. Grassley sent Secretary of State John Kerry a letter in January about the issue.

On the roster Hillary just wont leave democrats alone  Time Out Its what youre wearing ear to ear  Moderates seek more spending in bid to save TrumpCare  Heartburn for GOP in final vote on big spending bill  Actually never mind  HILLARY JUST WONT LEAVE DEMOCRATS ALONE  Democrats should be even more exhausted of hearing from and about Hillary Clinton then we are of writing about her – and thats saying a lot.  The twicefailed presidential candidate is inflicting herself anew on the woebegone party she helped put asunder. It is again about her embittered response to last years surprising defeat this time in the form in a truly weird backandforth with FBI Director James Comey.  Clinton was pressing her sour grapes at a womens forum where she told the audience that she would have won the election if only it had been held two weeks prior. Her reasoning is that the late collapse in her support was due to Comeys decision to announce the reopening of the criminal investigation into the former secretary of states mishandling of classified information.  Clinton has a point here. The torrent of negative coverage and the unhappy reminder of her tendency toward ethical misconduct was a quarterback sack for a campaign that was already warming up its endzone dance. Maybe if Comey hadnt said anything she would have pulled off a narrow victory instead of suffering a narrow defeat.  And if a frog had wings it wouldnt bump its backside when it hopped.  Clintons former Democratic Senate colleagues felt obliged to take up her cause today with Comey in his routine testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Their unsubtle inference was that the FBI director had acted maliciously.  Comey explained that he saw he had no choice. If Clinton had won as almost everyone including her opponent thought she would concealing the presence of new information about potential criminal charges against her would have been a catastrophe.  Comey could have easily imagined the moment when nowPresident Clinton is found to have willfully violated laws governing the handling of state secrets or potentially something even worse and that Comey had kept it from the voting public.  As it would turn out none of that would be a problem for the FBI director. The discovery of the new emails that led to Comeys outburst led to nothing of interest to the case and of course Clinton is not president.  No doubt Comey was a terrible scourge to Democratic aspirations in 2016. His initial announcement that Clinton was a liar but not in a way he thought could be prosecuted was sort of the worstcase scenario.  It was a damning political indictment but without a criminal indictment Democrats were still stuck with the moredamaged candidate who would turn out to be their worst nominee in generations.  That combined with Comeys yesnomaybeso October surprise did enormous damage to her already damaged brand. So did the Russianbacked hackers who stole embarrassing emails related to Clintons campaign and then provided them to an antiAmerican website.  But dare we ask At this point what difference does it make?  Clinton might be right that she might have won if the election was held earlier or if Putinists hadnt hung her dirty laundry in the breeze. But she also might have won if she hadnt mishandled state secrets or if she hadnt gorged herself on Wall Street honoraria or had an ethically rank family foundation or had no campaign message other than calling her opponent a misogynistic bigot or had not run a bloated outoftouch campaign organization or had actually campaigned in the upper Midwest or… well you get the idea.  The point being She did lose and in a humiliating fashion to a candidate she reportedly sought to encourage to get into the race believing him so stupid and crass that he was a sure loser.  That Clinton is still complaining and that she and her family after a failure of such magnitude would continue to impose themselves on a shattered Democratic Party is all of the evidence one would ever need of their solipsism and boundless selfregard.  Decency would compel most politicians to have mercy on a party they failed so lavishly. Clinton couldnt even summon the same level of circumspection as Al Gore who despite heroic levels of ego was at least ashamed enough to grow a beard after he lost.  Former President Barack Obama is treading lightly around the edges of politics at least so far. Like his predecessors Obama is trying to hold himself at some remove from the daytoday discourse.  Clinton however can summon no similar tack or grace in her defeat lamely declaring herself part of the resistance to her former rival now the president. Clinton is also launching a political action committee.  Ugh.  It is hard to say how many Democrats are still with her but it is increasingly apparent that it will take concerted effort and conscious action on the part of the party to expel her and her deposed royal house.  It is sad to say but the kindhearted impulse among Democrats to console their former nominee in her defeat would only lay the groundwork for the defeats of the future.  THE RULEBOOK NEW AND IMPROVED  The truth is that the great principles of the Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new than as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of Confederation. – James Madison Federalist No. 40  TIME OUT ITS WHAT YOURE WEARING EAR TO EAR  The Atlantic … theres an interesting line of research that helps explain outliers on the other end of the spectrum too Specifically Americans and their stereotypically megawatt smiles. It turns out that countries with lots of immigration have historically relied more on nonverbal communication—and thus people there might smile more. … Places like Canada and the United States are very diverse with 63 and 83 source countries respectively while countries like China and Zimbabwe are fairly homogenous with just a few nationalities represented in their populations. After polling people from 32 countries to learn how much they felt various feelings should be expressed openly the authors found that emotional expressiveness was correlated with diversity. In other words when there are a lot of immigrants around you might have to smile more to build trust and cooperation since you dont all speak the same language.  Flag on the play?

MODERATES SEEK MORE SPENDING IN BID TO SAVE TRUMPCARE  Bloomberg A key GOP holdout on the partys healthcare bill said Wednesday that he would back the measure saying he thinks an amendment he proposed may be enough to win passage in the House later this week. Representative Fred Upton of Michigan told reporters at the White House after a meeting with President Donald Trump that hes ready to vote for the bill once a new amendment he helped devise is added that would boost funding for people with preexisting conditions. … Republican Representative Billy Long of Missouri another holdout also said hes ready to back it. … Uptons amendment would provide 8 billion over five years to reduce premiums and other costs for those with preexisting conditions who have a gap in coverage and reside in states that received waivers from some of Obamacares requirements under another provision in the bill.  HEARTBURN FOR GOP IN FINAL VOTE ON BIG SPENDING BILL  AP House Speaker Paul Ryan sought to assure conservatives on Wednesday that a massive governmentwide spending bill is a win for President Donald Trump and Republicans citing a really good down payment on rebuilding the military and the biggest increase in border security in a decade. Ryan told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that the most important win for Republicans was breaking loose from former Democratic President Barack Obamas edict that increases in defense spending be matched with equal hikes for nondefense programs. The House is scheduled to vote on the bipartisan 1.1 trillion measure Wednesday afternoon. It is a product of weeks of Capitol Hill negotiations in which top Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi successfully blocked Trumps most controversial proposals including a down payment on the oftpromised Trump Mexico border wall cuts to popular domestic programs and new punishments for socalled sanctuary cities.  Byron York says that a hidden provision in the package jacks up the number of Visas for lowwage foreign workers.

Dan Sullivan proposes bill to break up 9th circuit  Wash Times  AUDIBLE URP  It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election. – Director James Comey said today during his hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  FROM THE BLEACHERS  The SchumerReidPelosiWarren Democratic Party will beyond peradventure kill the legislative filibuster the next time they have a Senate majority and it suits them to do so. There is zero chance that Democrats will reward Republican forbearance on the filibuster question by sticking to it in the future. Insofar as this is true the Republicans are simply inane to uphold the filibuster now. It is a Senate rule whose reliability has been killed and the Republicans cannot do anything about it. Their only sensible alternative is formally to bury the filibuster while they can get some benefit of doing so – now. – Charles W. Baird Reno Nev.  Ed. note It sounds a little Leninist for my liking Mr. Baird but I certainly take your point. Certainly political selfinterest would decree that Republicans smash and grab as much as they can. But I doubt that would make for better laws or a better country. Imposing large initiatives without bipartisan support is a bad idea. Embracing that practice because doing it the right way has become too hard is not a reflection on the rule but rather the inadequacy of our leaders. You may know my penchant for repealing the 17th Amendment but whatever it is that we do to fix our system should not be about making it easier for narrow majorities to wield more power. But thats certainly not the way were heading so maybe you are right – the GOP should pig out on power now and enjoy it while they can.  With the high cost of health care insurance for many people along with high copays perhaps the best health care plan would be for people to pay their individual doctors out of pocket. If government wants to make something mandatory they could mandate purchase of Catastrophic Health Care Insurance to cover unexpected medical problems that are costly. There are people who become overwhelmed because of health care problems or just lack of income but certainly we can figure out a way to help those people without penalizing everyone else and for many Obamacare IS a penalty. – Eleanor Korf Glendale Ariz.  Ed. note The stated aim of ObamaCare was to provide health insurance for an estimated 28 million Americans who lacked coverage. One of the problems was that many of them didnt actually want coverage at least at any fair price. The real issue was finding a way to provide coverage to those individuals who wanted but could not afford a policy but who were too well off to qualify for Medicaid. States were offered the chance to bump up income limits for the welfare program which resulted in about 11 million people getting coverage. Then came the subsidies for individuals who dont get health insurance through their employers which covers perhaps 10 million more. All of this comes at a hefty price and with massive disruption for the rest of sector. Figuring out a more affordable or effective way to do it is likely to bedevil both parties for many decades to come.

nyt,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/obituaries/phyllis-schlafly-conservative-leader-and-foe-of-era-dies-at-92.html,Shes an extremely liberated woman Ms. DeCrow said in an interview with Carol Felsenthal for her book The Sweetheart of the Silent Majority The Biography of Phyllis Schlafly 1981. She sets out to do something and she does it. To me thats liberation.  Still Mrs. Schlaflys pronouncements drove her antagonists to distraction though they suspected that her biting language was calculated precisely to provoke their outrage. She said that sexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women and that sexeducation classes are like inhome sales parties for abortions. She called the atom bomb a marvelous gift that was given to our country by a wise God.  In 1980 a protester threw an apple pie in her face at a Womens National Republican Club reception in New York painfully scratching an eye.  Photo  But Mrs. Schlafly was never outwardly ruffled. When Ms. Friedan during a debate at Indiana University in 1973 recommended that she burn at the stake Mrs. Schlafly replied in an even voice that she was pleased Ms. Friedan had said that because she said the comment had made it plain to the audience just how intolerant intemperate agitating proponents of the E.R.A. were.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Staunch G.O.P. Roots  She was born Phyllis McAlpin Stewart on Aug. 15 1924 in St. Louis the oldest of two daughters of the former Odile Dodge a teacher with two college degrees and John Bruce Stewart a machinist and industrial equipment salesman who was 17 years his wifes senior.  Fired by Westinghouse at the onset of the Depression Mr. Stewart was never quite able to put the familys finances back together. In 1944 he won a patent for a rotary car engine of the type the Japanese automaker Mazda later sold but it went nowhere.  Despite his hardships Mr. Stewart remained a staunch Republican fiercely opposed to the New Deal.  Mrs. Stewart who was ambitious for her daughters supported the family with a series of jobs department store saleswoman elementary school teacher and librarian at the St. Louis Art Museum. In her spare time she wrote a book on the history of St. Louis.  Ms. Felsenthal suggested in her book that Mrs. Schlaflys impatience with women who denigrated homemaking stemmed in part from her mothers wish that she could have kept house and worked for good causes rather than report for work six days a week.  Phyllis Stewart attended Maryville College of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis now Maryville University and transferred to Washington University. She had no time for friends dates or sororities she wrote instead as a student she worked nights at a munitions factory testfiring guns.  Even so she managed to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in only three years at 19. She won a scholarship to study political science at Radcliffe and earned a masters degree there in nine months.  Her politics were middle of the road at first. In 1940 she supported the moderate Republican Wendell Willkie in his bid to deny President Franklin D. Roosevelt a third term and in graduate school she wrote papers supporting an active United Nations. Her ambition was to work for the federal government in Washington.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  When no government jobs turned up she found a spot at a conservative think tank the American Enterprise Association the forerunner of the American Enterprise Institute. Educating herself in conservative philosophy she submitted articles against the New Deal to Redbook and other magazines but they were rejected.  In 1946 she returned to St. Louis to work on the successful congressional campaign of Claude I. Bakewell a Republican. After that she worked as a librarian and researcher at a bank and at 24 met John Fred Schlafly Jr. a 39yearold lawyer and politically engaged conservative from an Alton family that had made its money in banking and industry. They were married on Oct. 20 1949.  At the ceremony Mrs. Schlafly said she did not promise to obey only to cherish. But she delighted in portraying herself as a traditional wife even as she kept to a hectic pace of travel writing speaking and campaigning after her oldest child turned 18 months.  Photo  I want to thank my husband Fred for letting me come here was a favorite opening for speeches. I like to say that she said because I know it irritates womens libbers more than anything else.  But the writer Gail Sheehy suggested that Mrs. Schlafly had used marriage to liberate herself from paying jobs. Phyllis Schlaflys formula for the better life then is based on marrying a rich professional climbing the pedestal to lady of leisure and pulling up the rope ladder behind her Ms. Sheehy wrote in The New York Times in 1980.  Mrs. Schlafly was introduced to electoral politics in 1952 after Republicans had asked her husband to run for Congress. When he turned them down Mrs. Schlafly who was 27 volunteered in his stead. She won the Republican primary but lost the general election.  That experience she said helped her overcome her natural shyness and she went on to make dozens of speeches in Illinois as an officer of the Daughters of the American Revolution and to start building a national network of conservative friends. She was the president of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women from 1956 to 1964.  In 1958 she and her husband started the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation — named for the Roman Catholic leader who was tortured and imprisoned by Hungarian Communists — to educate Catholics on the dangers of Communism. Beginning in 1962 she hosted a 15minute radio show on national security called America Wake Up. It was carried by 25 Illinois stations.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Schlaflys politics were concentrated on the external threat posed by Communism not the crusade against domestic Communist infiltration led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. They opposed summit meetings and limits on nuclear testing and favored a constitutional amendment to prevent the president from negotiating international treaties.  Many members of the Mindszenty Foundation were also members of the ultraright John Birch Society and its founder Robert Welch once called Mrs. Schlafly one of our most loyal members. The Schlaflys denied they were members.  In 1964 Mrs. Schlafly was an active supporter of Goldwaters presidential campaign. In her selfpublished pocketsize book promoting his candidacy A Choice Not an Echo she contended that Republican presidential nominations were rigged by secret kingmakers. By some estimates the book sold as many as 3.5 million copies.  Writing in The New Yorker in 2005 Elizabeth Kolbert said the book mixed fact sensational accusations commonsensical truths and elaborate conspiracy theories into a compelling but evidently bogus narrative.  Mrs. Schlafly became closely identified with Goldwaters landslide defeat in 1964 and in 1967 she lost a bitter campaign for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women. Another run for Congress from another Illinois district in 1970 also ended in defeat.  Targeting the E.R.A.  During much of the 1960s and 70s Mrs. Schlafly wrote books about national defense issues often working with Chester Ward a retired Navy admiral. Their Kissinger on the Couch 1975 begins with a proposition Suppose that Henry Kissinger is in the common parlance some kind of nut or something. In more than 800 pages they argued that he was.  Photo  Mrs. Schlafly hardly noticed the Equal Rights Amendment when it was first debated in Congress. Her initial inclination was to support it as something between innocuous and mildly helpful she told Ms. Felsenthal. But when in December 1971 a friend asked her to debate a feminist on the amendment she read up on the issue and decided that the E.R.A. was dangerous and needed to be stopped. It had already passed the House.  The next October Mrs. Schlafly founded and appointed herself chairwoman of Stop ERA the volunteer organization that became the Eagle Forum. The stop was an acronym for stop taking our privileges effectively summarizing the position of the amendments opponents. They worried that earlier laws written to protect women — guaranteeing alimony and exempting women from combat for instance — would be jettisoned.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  I simply didnt believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect womens rights Mrs. Schlafly told The Times in 2006. I knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husbands permission to make wine.  Proponents of the amendment have said that even though courts and legislatures have set aside statutes that discriminate based on sex the amendment would still retain symbolic importance.  Unwelcome Revelation  Mrs. Schlaflys followers only grew in number after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973 an issue that social conservatives saw as a further erosion of the countrys moral values.  After her husband died in 1993 Mrs. Schlafly moved from their limestone house on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Alton to a brick colonialstyle house in the suburbs of St. Louis where the Eagle Forum has its headquarters.  Mrs. Schlafly is survived by six children 16 grandchildren and three greatgrandchildren.  Her son John gained attention in 1992 when a gay activist revealed that he was homosexual. Mrs. Schlafly said she considered the disclosure a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. The revelation did not alter her disapproval of gay marriage. In 2010 she said of gay couples Nobodys stopping them from shacking up. The problem is that they are trying to make us respect them and thats an interference with what we believe.  John Schlafly defended his mother and refused to repudiate Republican politicians like Pat Robertson who had condemned homosexuality. Family values people are not out to bash gays he said.  Mrs. Schlafly maintained an energetic pace into advanced age. In 2011 she spoke out for shotgun marriages as the solution to unwanted pregnancies. Even as supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment tried to revive it Mrs. Schlafly strove to make sure it stayed dead.  In March of this year she endorsed Donald J. Trump for president saying he had the courage and the energy to do what the grassroots want him to do.  In her 2006 interview with The Times she attributed the improvement in womens lives in the 20th century not to feminism but to laborsaving devices like the indoor clothes dryer and paper diapers.
