## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Immutable Hugging Face distribution for the six trained model artifacts.
- Offline tests for artifact resolution, missing inputs, and index alignment.

### Changed

- Export model vocabularies, coefficients, and calibration curves as typed
  Parquet rather than loading version-bound scikit-learn pickles.
- Use the py-canon Sphinx configuration and reusable CI, docs, and release
  workflows.
- Build documentation directly from the README and public docstrings.

### Fixed

- Preserve non-default DataFrame indices when assigning category probabilities.
- Classify duplicate-index LLM inputs row by row instead of mixing their results.
- Return typed output columns for empty URL-classification inputs.
- Leave missing text rows unclassified instead of predicting from empty text.
- Feed model vectorizers the raw text used by their training pipelines.
- Bound dense feature allocation during portable inference and reuse category
  probabilities for label selection.

### Removed

- Packaged joblib artifacts; runtime model tables now resolve from the pinned
  Hub revision.
- The joblib, scikit-learn, and NLTK runtime dependencies.
- Duplicated generated documentation and the legacy publish workflow.
